## Instructions
This program opens with a login screen. Upon validation, the user is navigated to a main menu where they can choose to go to a customer page, an appointment page, a report page, or exit the program. 

The customer and appointment pages present the user with all customers or appointments, respectively. Each has add, modify, and delete buttons that can be used to modify the data.

The report page shows the user reports that cannot be modified or deleted.

## Additional Report Explanation
Aside from the mandatory reports, I chose to display a report that shows the user the number of appointments by country. If a company is operating globally, it is important to have accurate information that can be acted on to make business decisions, so this seemed like a very appropriate report to include.
